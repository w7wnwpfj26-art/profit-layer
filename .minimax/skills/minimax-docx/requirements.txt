# Keep this skill dependency-free by default for multi-environment execution.
# Optional capabilities are lazily imported and degrade gracefully when absent.

# Optional dependencies (install as needed):
#   pip install matplotlib      # For chart rendering (render/data_plot.py)
#   pip install playwright && playwright install chromium  # For HTML rendering (render/html_canvas.py)
#   pip install Pillow          # For image analysis (check/detectors.py)
